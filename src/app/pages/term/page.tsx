       This template may be used to create the terms and conditions for a medical information website. The medical information may be wholly or partially unavailable to unregistered users. However, the template is unsuitable for websites requiring users to pay for access to the information.
The publication of medical information carries with it special risk. A reader might refrain from seeing a doctor, stop taking medication or ignore a doctor's advice after reading the website. In the worse case, a person could suffer injury or even death if information on the website is wrong or misinterpreted.

Whilst it isn't possible to eliminate all risks, a well-drafted set of website terms and conditions can be very helpful in the event of a complaint or legal action.

As well as incorporating a special disclaimer in relation to medical information, this document contains all the standard website-related legal provisions, covering such matters as the use and misuse of the website, statutory information disclosures and the consequences of a breach of the terms and conditions.
